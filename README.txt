Work been done

1)Removed Etrust and replaced with Koideine ACL (more light weight and easier to manage Role & Permissions

2)Added Elasticquent in order to make ALL laravel system as one. Laravel works best with Eloquent Models than custom PHP calls, so I have replaced it with Elasticquent in order to keep code simple and concrete.

3) Made all databases with Migrations & Seeders, its Laravel! No custom tables via phpmyadmin, its not a good practise.

4)
