Work been done

1)Removed Etrust and replaced with Koideine ACL (more light weight and easier to manage Role & Permissions

2)Added Elasticquent in order to make ALL laravel system as one. Laravel works best with Eloquent Models than custom PHP calls, so I have replaced it with Elasticquent in order to keep code simple and concrete.

3) Made all databases with Migrations & Seeders, its Laravel! No custom tables via phpmyadmin, its not a good practise.

4) Made all models in Laravel needed

5) Made basic listing with Gallery working

6) Started making user portal for managing his listings

7) Fixed all routes to the correct format
